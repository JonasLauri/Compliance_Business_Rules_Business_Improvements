# Compliance Business Rules Process Improvements
This is real example of one business process in the compliance area (FCP) which was changed and improved together with other team support. It took 2 - 3 month to change and optimize process steps for one daily operational task. The task is performed every week and is crusial for operational teams as this process reduces operational load and FTE.

Business case and detail information about process steps can be seen in the PDF file: Further Improvements for Temporary Business Rules Management.pdf
